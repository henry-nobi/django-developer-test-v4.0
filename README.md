## About Me
Hello! I'm Henry Tran, a dedicated software developer from Nobisoft with 4 years of experience in developing enterprise applications. I thrive on tackling challenges and take pride in my high level of responsibility in the workplace. My meticulous approach ensures that I handle every task with great care and precision.

I have another repository where I commit changes carefully. However, I realize it contains secret keys, so I can't share it.

If you need the `.env` file to run the application, you can email me. You can also provide feedback about my test through my email. I greatly appreciate it.

You can reach me at: [hung.tm@nobisoft.com.vn](mailto:hung.tm@nobisoft.com.vn)

Let's connect and create something amazing together!
